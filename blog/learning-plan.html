      <h1>Bootcamp learning plan</h1>
      <h1>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>
      <p>First, I want to find a job in the developer field to gain experience and expand my knowledge. During this period, I aim to build both practical experience and technical skills. Later, I plan to combine this knowledge with my previous expertise and launch my own business.</h1>
      <h1>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h1>
      <p>I always strive for perfection, especially when learning. I feel the need to understand every single line of code. Sometimes, this takes a long time, and I need to manage my time better during the Bootcamp. </p>
      <h1>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h1>
      <p>Going to campus during weekdays. need to manage my time efficiently. </p>
      <h1>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
      <p>I want to learn how to listen to people and truly internalize their perspectives. Sometimes, this can be challenging for me.</p>
      <h1>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h1>
      <p>Learning more things as much I cam</p>
      <h1>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h1>
      <p>I've invested a lot of time, money, and effort into my studies. However, this is my decision, and I know I need to keep going. Even when I feel like giving up, I remind myself of why I decided to study in the first place: to learn new things, meet new people, and become a better version of myself.</p>
      <h1>Foundation learning plan</h1>
      <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
      <p>First, I aspire to become a full-stack developer. Gaining experience in this field will provide me with valuable skills and a wealth of inspiration. Building on that experience and the ideas it sparks, I plan to eventually start my own business. </p>
      <h1>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h1>
      <p>Being creative is one of my strengths, as it allows me to think of alternative ways to solve problems. However, this also means I sometimes take more time to find a solution because I explore different approaches before deciding on the best one. </p>
      <h1>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
      <p>Seeing developers from diverse backgrounds is inspiring. I believe most people at Dev Academy come with unique experiences and perspectives. I’m excited about how this diversity will give me new insights and broaden my approach to solving problems.</p>
      <h1>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h1>
      <p>I separate my study time and break time, which helps me stay focused on what I need to do during each period. This structure allows me to maintain productivity while also ensuring I get the rest I need to stay refreshed.</p>
      <h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
      <p>I will reach out for help (if I need) via the discord channel.</p>
      <h1>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h1>
