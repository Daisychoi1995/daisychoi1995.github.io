      <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
      <p>First, I aspire to become a full-stack developer. Gaining experience in this field will provide me with valuable skills and a wealth of inspiration. Building on that experience and the ideas it sparks, I plan to eventually start my own business. </p>
      <h1>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h1>
      <p>Being creative is one of my strengths, as it allows me to think of alternative ways to solve problems. However, this also means I sometimes take more time to find a solution because I explore different approaches before deciding on the best one. </p>
      <h1>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
      <p>Seeing developers from diverse backgrounds is inspiring. I believe most people at Dev Academy come with unique experiences and perspectives. I’m excited about how this diversity will give me new insights and broaden my approach to solving problems.</p>
      <h1>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h1>
      <p>I separate my study time and break time, which helps me stay focused on what I need to do during each period. This structure allows me to maintain productivity while also ensuring I get the rest I need to stay refreshed.</p>
      <h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
      <p>I will reach out for help (if I need) via the discord channel.</p>
      <h1>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h1>
      <p>I will reach out for help (if I need) via the discord channel.</p>
      <h1>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h1>
      <p>I actually got 2 importannt plan in 2 monnth time. 27th Feb(Thursday) and might visit Korea 12th Mar-19th Mar(TBC). I would like to discuss this with Facilitation team.</p>
