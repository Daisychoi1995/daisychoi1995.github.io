  <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
  <p>Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to change, rewire, and form new connections throughout life. This means that with consistent effort and practice, we can improve our skills and knowledge. The more we practice coding, the stronger our neural pathways become, making it easier over time.
    Struggling with a new concept is part of the learning process—the brain adapts through repetition.
    Example: At first, JavaScript closures might feel confusing, but with practice and exposure, they become clearer.</p>
    <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
    <p>A growth mindset, developed by Carol Dweck, is the belief that intelligence and abilities are not fixed but can grow with effort and perseverance. How It Influences Learning:
      
      Instead of saying, "I’m bad at coding," a growth mindset encourages "I’m still learning, and I’ll get better with practice."
      Challenges and mistakes are seen as opportunities to grow rather than as failures.
      Example: If debugging a React app is difficult, a growth mindset helps you stay motivated instead of giving up.
      </p>
      <h1>Combining Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset for Effective Learning</h1>
      <p>Understanding neuroplasticity helps us see that learning is a physical process—our brain literally changes.
        Adopting a growth mindset keeps us motivated and helps us embrace challenges instead of avoiding them.
        Example: When learning full-stack development, both concepts encourage continuous improvement and resilience.</p>
