      <h1>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h1>
      <p>Back in university, while working on a research paper, a teammate once suggested we skip the experiment since we already knew the expected outcome. But I felt it was important to carry out the experiment to ensure our results were reliable, so I insisted on doing it the right way.</p>
      <h1>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h1>
      <p>Growing up surrounded by people, I learned the importance of enjoying what I do and having fun along the way. It has always motivated me to stay true to myself and keep moving forward.</p>
      <h1>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h1>
      <p>My strength is my creativity. It allows me to think outside the box, find unique solutions to problems, and approach challenges with fresh perspectives. This will support me in my learning journey by helping me adapt to new concepts, tackle tasks in innovative ways, and stay motivated as I explore and grow. </p>
      <h1>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h1>
