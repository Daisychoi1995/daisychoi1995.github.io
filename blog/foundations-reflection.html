    <h1>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h1>
    <p> I tend to strive for perfection in everything I do. I have learned that accepting failure is crucial for my growth.My ego sometimes makes me anxious when things aren't perfect, but I’ve learned that even small achievements are valuable.</p>
    <h1>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
    <p>Values keep you motivated, empathy makes your work meaningful, and self-awareness helps you grow. In both learning and programming, these three elements shape how you improve and collaborate! </p>
    <h1>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h1>
    <p>Human skills don’t just help with communication—they directly impact how I learn, work, and grow as a programmer! </p>
    <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h1>
    <p>Reflacting myself</p>
    <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h1>
    <p>A bootcamp prepares students for real-world jobs, and real-world programming is about people as much as it is about code.</p>
    <h1>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>
    <p>Nope, It was meaningful</p>
